## ðŸ›‘ Problem Statement

In today's digital job market, distinguishing between real and fake job postings has become increasingly difficult. Scammers often mimic legitimate job advertisements â€” using the same platforms such as online job boards, social media, newspapers, and even TV or radio. These fraudulent postings are designed to steal sensitive personal information or money from unsuspecting job seekers.

This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of identifying whether a job posting is real or fake based on its content. By analyzing patterns in text-based and categorical features, the model attempts to detect deceptive indicators and reduce the risk for job applicants.
